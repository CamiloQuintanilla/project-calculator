# project-calculator

> # Description
This Python code implements a graphical calculator using the Tkinter library. The user interface includes numeric buttons, mathematical operators, and functions like square root. The calculator allows input of mathematical expressions and performs calculations.

> # Key Features
### `Graphical Interface`:
The graphical interface is created using Tkinter, providing an visually appealing and user-friendly calculator.

### `Dark Theme`:
A dark theme is included to change the interface appearance and enhance readability in low-light environments.

### `Keyboard Input`:
Data can be input using the keyboard, supporting numbers, operators, and mathematical functions.

### `Basic Operations`:
Supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### `Additional Functions`:
Includes functions like deleting digits, clearing the entire input, and calculating the square root.

> # Usage
### `Numeric Buttons`:
Click on the numeric buttons to input desired digits.

### `Mathematical Operators`:
Use the operator buttons to perform basic mathematical operations.

### `Enter Key (=)`:
Pressing the Enter key (=) evaluates the entered expression and displays the result.

### `Key C`:
Pressing the C key clears the current input.

### `Key Del`:
Pressing the Del key deletes the last entered digit.

### `Key √`:
Pressing the √ key calculates the square root of the entered number.

> # Dark Theme and Light Theme
### `Dark Theme (Shortcut: 'o')`:
Changes the interface to a dark theme to improve visibility in low-light environments.

### `Light Theme (Shortcut: 'c')`:
Restores the interface to the default light theme.

> # Keyboard Input
### `Numeric and Operator Keys`:
You can input numbers and operators directly from the keyboard.

### `Enter Key (=)`:
Pressing the Enter key from the keyboard evaluates the entered expression and displays the result.

> # Additional Keyboard Shortcuts
### `Delete Last Digit (Shortcut: 'b')`:
Pressing the 'b' key deletes the last entered digit.

### `Clear Entire Input (Shortcut: 'q')`:
Pressing the 'q' key clears the entire current input.

## `Running the Program`
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the provided Python script.
The calculator will open with the graphical interface.

> # Requirements
- Python 3.11.5
- Tkinter (included with most Python installations)

> # Notes
This program uses the eval function to evaluate mathematical expressions. Be cautious when entering complex expressions to avoid potential security risks.
